# credit-risk-classification

In this project we built a machine learning model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers using lending data. 

The primary objectives of this project was to classify loans as either high-risk or healthy based on different factors like loan amount, intrest rate and borrower details. 

This model will help lending companies assess the risk of approving loans and making better decisions.
